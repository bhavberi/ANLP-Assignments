but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope milady answered by a glance which said is that allspeak then and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words that is but too just said she tenderly :- 137.63816621002155

yet he did not return home :- 63.90628888845166
