4. Run the python files.

Link to download the models: [https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bhav_beri_research_iiit_ac_in/EloKBiLlvnZIqp6MJVUOQbABbAURKnj36o3aN22xgetGqQ?e=KWA6ce](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bhav_beri_research_iiit_ac_in/EloKBiLlvnZIqp6MJVUOQbABbAURKnj36o3aN22xgetGqQ?e=KWA6ce)

This submission was made while using 5000 train samples and 1000 validation samples. Testing is done on 1000 samples. The primary reason for this is the amount of time and compute required for training/testing with a larger dataset. Please refer to report for further values which may be of interest to you.
