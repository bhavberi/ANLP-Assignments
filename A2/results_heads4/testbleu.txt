when i was in my 20s, i saw my very first psychotherapy client. 0.03609023856222073
i was a ph.d. student in clinical psychology at berkeley. 0.017033186037639283
she was a 26-year-old woman named alex. 0.022835060540062107
now alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top, and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems. 0.004255317692616196
now when i heard this, i was so relieved. 0.018693000799960027
my classmate got an arsonist for her first client. 0.0072658577559704465
and i got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys. 0.015032178405940613
this i thought i could handle. 0.039281465090051315
but i didn't handle it. 0.18575057999133598
with the funny stories that alex would bring to session, it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road. 0.008724383945340666
 thirty's the new 20, alex would say, and as far as i could tell, she was right. 0.020687206010259408
work happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later, even death happened later. 0.010172205866217513
twentysomethings like alex and i had nothing but time. 0.017487432819564223
but before long, my supervisor pushed me to push alex about her love life. 0.025019663137100082
i pushed back. 0.08034284189446518
i said, sure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a knucklehead, but it's not like she's going to marry the guy.  0.021454591565574624
and then my supervisor said, not yet, but she might marry the next one. 0.023956565612760213
besides, the best time to work on alex's marriage is before she has one.  0.010331208012220438
that's what psychologists call an aha! moment. 0.05307712171072445
that was the moment i realized, 30 is not the new 20. 0.03344511038039969
yes, people settle down later than they used to, but that didn't make alex's 20s a developmental downtime. 0.007293301163414325
that made alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot, and we were sitting there blowing it. 0.03048820182892172
that was when i realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere. 0.0052964490579083525
there are 50 million twentysomethings in the united states right now. 0.06770149544242768
we're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first. 0.0902349678619119
raise your hand if you're in your 20s. 0.0169861974906263
i really want to see some twentysomethings here. 0.028709564316081952
oh, yay! y'all's awesome. 0.04939382737115371
if you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething, you're losing sleep over twentysomethings, i want to see okay. awesome, twentysomethings really matter. 0.011848246737657336
so i specialize in twentysomethings because i believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists already know: that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest, yet most transformative, things you can do for work, for love, for your happiness, maybe even for the world. 0.012219662673429317
this is not my opinion. these are the facts. 0.08606445183091939
we know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35. 0.0601429426464788
that means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and aha! moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s. 0.011692093421606195
people who are over 40, don't panic. 0.039320498864645864
this crowd is going to be fine, i think. 0.08032276872815308
we know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn. 0.036752344561789704
we know that more than half of americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30. 0.03949296439011767
we know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood, which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself, now is the time to change it. 0.021568402174221155
we know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28, and things get tricky after age 35. 0.03425660434362857
so your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options. 0.017502413882486995
so when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. 0.007920038643543535
it's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become. 0.012021577610863726
but what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development, and our 20s are that critical period of adult development. 0.015331320282974655
but this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing. 0.11094660471566163
newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood. 0.01618861356572822
researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence. 0.01428363257865929
journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like twixters and kidults.  0.015138514598766055
it's true. 0.10785809837243004
as a culture, we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood. 0.060905111119656574
leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not quite enough time. 0.006808256983563219
isn't that true? 0.09554427922043669
so what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say, you have 10 extra years to start your life ? 0.005965518750356762
nothing happens. 0.020237345084409754
you have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition, and absolutely nothing happens. 0.022023814946586635
and then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this: i know my boyfriend's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. i'm just killing time.  0.012564215801091018
or they say, everybody says as long as i get started on a career by the time i'm 30, i'll be fine.  0.016339463529248827
but then it starts to sound like this: my 20s are almost over, and i have nothing to show for myself. 0.03809096946542823
i had a better résumé the day after i graduated from college.  0.017395797375642234
and then it starts to sound like this: dating in my 20s was like musical chairs. 0.007087648989046159
everybody was running around and having fun, but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down. 0
i didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30.  0.01986162691244834
where are the twentysomethings here? 0.05411516285864537
do not do that. 0.043472087194499145
okay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake, the stakes are very high. 0.03532118269524541
when a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time. 0.0047858819807434635
many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s. 0.006771430219953416
the post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car. 0.01437841846606559
it's realizing you can't have that career you now want. 0.012021577610863726
it's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibling. 0.017448767890681335
too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room, and say about their 20s, what was i doing? what was i thinking?  0.012362883593468847
i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking. 0.0238816948476546
here's a story about how that can go. 0.024808415001701823
it's a story about a woman named emma. 0.03303164318013808
at 25, emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis. 0.004255317692616196
she said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead. 0.007567143835953721
because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition. 0.009417632649968437
and as hard as her 20s were, her early life had been even harder. 0.005295924024539148
she often cried in our sessions, but then would collect herself by saying, you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.  0.007817381459512229
well one day, emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap, and she sobbed for most of the hour. 0.0037451550450560973
she'd just bought a new address book, and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts, but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words in case of emergency, please call ... .  0.007567143835953721
she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said, who's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck? 0.008531104334876973
who's going to take care of me if i have cancer?  0.01909690192411307
now in that moment, it took everything i had not to say, i will.  0.013537696101187317
but what emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared. 0.030583133366746233
emma needed a better life, and i knew this was her chance. 0.06560264840246194
i had learned too much since i first worked with alex to just sit there while emma's defining decade went parading by. 0
so over the next weeks and months, i told emma three things that every twentysomething, male or female, deserves to hear. 0.005060454076656144
first, i told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital. 0.011191021613657745
by get identity capital, i mean do something that adds value to who you are. 0.021042495247559002
do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next. 0.014400124446705301
i didn't know the future of emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but i do know this: identity capital begets identity capital. 0.020904996083879822
so now is the time for that cross-country job, that internship, that startup you want to try. 0.009772992164303737
i'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here, but i am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count, which, by the way, is not exploration. 0.011406785378490644
that's procrastination. 0.069372929071742
i told emma to explore work and make it count. 0.015448671909765663
second, i told emma that the urban tribe is overrated. 0.020200106912694155
best friends are great for giving rides to the airport, but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work. 0.01164069729160941
that new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle. 0.005081835741365613
new things come from what are called our weak ties, our friends of friends of friends. 0.006716472052354862
so yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed. 0.018515655955607467
but half aren't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group. 0.11213336822390839
half of new jobs are never posted, so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that un-posted job. 0.013722599955986394
it's not cheating. it's the science of how information spreads. 0.021459384240169233
last but not least, emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends. 0.006115004303675009
now this was true for her growing up, but as a twentysomething, soon emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own. 0
i told emma the time to start picking your family is now. 0.015775377779808884
now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20, or even 25, and i agree with you. 0.03351542279475122
but grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress. 0.0070387276012397765
the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work. 0.006909792747415067
picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you. 0.007425055521504611
so what happened to emma? 0.025098621243978974
well, we went through that address book, and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state. 0.004375436627586616
that weak tie helped her get a job there. 0.01859351593152887
that job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend. 0.01427369885303147
now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums. 0.012673718536830811
she's married to a man she mindfully chose. 0.025271148634948993
she loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough.  0.008939891008723787
now emma's story made that sound easy, but that's what i love about working with twentysomethings. 0.056217896981982304
they are so easy to help. 0.08428828344718171
twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving lax, bound for somewhere west. 0.019320990745681776
right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in alaska or fiji. 0.019051955393615476
likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29, one good conversation, one good break, one good ted talk, can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come. 0.010825229011972713
so here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know. 0.014644332236416991
it's as simple as what i learned to say to alex. 0.03514847831369806
it's what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma every single day: thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood, get some identity capital, use your weak ties, pick your family. 0.02140311488246744
don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. 0.014296145628396562
you're deciding your life right now. 0.037684991644924185
thank you. 0.316227766016838
throughout the history of computers we've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild. 0.008510635385232392
and this gap has become shorter, shorter, and even shorter, and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter, the thickness of a touch-screen glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone. 0.006659932104026654
but i wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all? 0.028927969316143217
i started to imagine what this would look like. 0.021105340631872645
first, i created this tool which penetrates into the digital space, so when you press it hard on the screen, it transfers its physical body into pixels. 0.004024431001434524
designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3d, and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen. 0.029224865149786863
so with this tool, this boundary has been broken. 0.019900763312868126
but our two hands still remain outside the screen. 0.012109013026441871
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands? 0.0085686357268259
at microsoft applied sciences, along with my mentor cati boulanger, i redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace. 0.007920038643543535
by combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face, now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3d space and grab pixels with your bare hands. 0.009680725341678643
because windows and files have a position in the real space, selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf. 0.014577516118523641
then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines, words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window. 0.010052917730344396
architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly. 0.019765441873349214
so in these examples, we are reaching into the digital world. 0.017395797375642234
but how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead? 0.008517399705356638
i'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online. 0.01332691735545882
but now you don't have to worry about it. 0.017395797375642234
what i got here is an online augmented fitting room. 0.01553712569276035
this is a view that you get from head-mounted or see-through display when the system understands the geometry of your body. 0.019933673568014454
taking this idea further, i started to think, instead of just seeing these pixels in our space, how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it? 0.01323614238074055
what would such a future look like? 0.03303164318013808
at mit media lab, along with my advisor hiroshi ishii and my collaborator rehmi post, we created this one physical pixel. 0.004255317692616196
well, in this case, this spherical magnet acts like a 3d pixel in our space, which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3d space. 0.007567143835953721
what we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies. 0.010968473790606286
and by digitally programming the object, we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space, which means that now, human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world. 0.0047858819807434635
so choreography can be taught physically over distance and michael jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality. 0.008388487457231183
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion, physics, and unlike computer screens or textbooks, this is a real, tangible experience that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful. 0.027323996399904755
and what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities. 0.03687915737861764
as you can see, the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world. 0.012640956753821412
today, we started by talking about the boundary, but if we remove this boundary, the only boundary left is our imagination. 0.10754999784156925
thank you. 0.316227766016838
so i was trained to become a gymnast for two years in hunan, china in the 1970s. 0.005409880072118434
when i was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. 0.007567143835953721
but my tiger mother said, no.  0.1122444464861146
my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. 0.02145851237135921
after surviving the cultural revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. 0.01542345413162388
it is not important if i like the job or not. 0.018693000799960027
but my dream was to become a chinese opera singer. 0.056122223243057295
that is me playing my imaginary piano. 0.024549475440235117
an opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so i tried everything i could to go to opera school. 0.007087648989046159
i even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. 0.015138514598766055
but no adults liked the idea. 0.024925978674400287
no adults believed i was serious. 0.02163211878762423
only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as i was. 0.02560744480557418
so at age 15, i knew i was too old to be trained. 0.028927969316143217
my dream would never come true. 0.045480190470279055
i was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best i could hope for. 0.020876149875884896
but that's so unfair. 0.14643803168582153
so i was determined to find another calling. 0.028517539529041507
nobody around to teach me? fine. 0.040824829046386304
i turned to books. 0.03849815007763549
i satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.[ correspondence in the family of fou lei ] i found my role model of an independent woman when confucian tradition requires obedience.[ jane eyre ] and i learned to be efficient from this book.[ cheaper by the dozen ] and i was inspired to study abroad after reading these. 0.0052964490579083525
[ complete works of sanmao ] [ lessons from history by nan huaijin] i came to the u.s. in 1995, so which books did i read here first? 0.007156562786973337
books banned in china, of course. 0.024808415001701823
 the good earth is about chinese peasant life. 0.1073897713503587
that's just not convenient for propaganda. got it. 0.02915032279375143
the bible is interesting, but strange. 0.07386099955930606
that's a topic for a different day. 0.021105340631872645
but the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: you shall honor your father and mother.  0.015226277779914149
 honor, i said. that's so different, and better, than obey.  0.03312498979466406
so it becomes my tool to climb out of this confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. 0.009871721786705418
encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. 0.007913247271422612
it offers many insights. 0.033031643180138064
for example, i found this map out of place at first because this is what chinese students grew up with. 0.0077426364109627836
it had never occurred to me, china doesn't have to be at the center of the world. 0.02507378338946741
a map actually carries somebody's view. 0.018850319022747353
comparative reading actually is nothing new. 0.028240990488565418
it's a standard practice in the academic world. 0.025098621243978974
there are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. 0.015071676257541071
compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. 0.013298958652957459
so i thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too? 0.024413329283346445
so i started reading books in pairs. 0.05022037190492093
so they can be about people -- [ benjamin franklin by walter isaacson][ john adams by david mccullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences. 0.01070155744123372
[ personal history by katharine graham][ the snowball: warren buffett and the business of life, by alice schroeder] i also compare the same stories in different genres -- [holy bible: king james version][ lamb by chrisopher moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as joseph campbell did in his wonderful book.[ the power of myth by joseph campbell] for example, both the christ and the buddha went through three temptations. 0.004928901229276252
for the christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual. 0.03201406061582137
for the buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. 0.012322506848565618
so if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages. 0.028753380961256264
[ the way of chuang tzu thomas merton][ tao: the watercourse way alan watts] instead of lost in translation, i found there is much to gain. 0.0037451550450560973
for example, it's through translation that i realized happiness in chinese literally means fast joy. huh! 0.012819825042984193
 bride in chinese literally means new mother. uh-oh. 0.009629943614188135
books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. 0.023956565612760213
i know i shall never feel lonely or powerless again. 0.03592143420342892
having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. 0.009152541620698935
i have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. 0.03058760346458022
its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from. 0.0037451550450560973
even a shattered dream can do that for you. 0.024088562704853513
so because of books, i'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time. 0.015387660309188709
so may books be always with you. 0.035065941041239286
thank you. 0.316227766016838
thank you. 0.316227766016838
thank you. 0.316227766016838
so when i was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. 0.0037451550450560973
she had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. 0.00284570245153172
and i just curdled with jealousy that year, until i hatched my devious plan. 0.014173229060880447
so one day i stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and i lurked in the girls' bathroom. 0.008243191945517347
when the coast was clear, i emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. 0.017997802579930305
and then i did it. 0.17567205239427922
i fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those a's. 0.05432423799142818
all of those a's. 0.040824829046386304
and i got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. 0.01786336545684448
so, in a frenzy, i corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. 0.060019785462717176
i gave everybody a row of d's and i gave myself a row of a's, just because i was there, you know, might as well. 0.01119951575382439
and i am still baffled by my behavior. 0.06164542728425844
i don't understand where the idea came from. 0.06164542728425844
i don't understand why i felt so great doing it. 0.03514847831369806
i felt great. 0.05795053470733952
i don't understand why i was never caught. 0.045293761707938834
i mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. 0.015138514598766055
i was never caught. 0.05231223689135342
but most of all, i am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? 0.012988310144953831
jealousy baffles me. 0
it's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. 0.05307712171072445
we know babies suffer from jealousy. 0.024761510494160165
we know primates do. bluebirds are actually very prone. 0.03783660158337722
we know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states. 0.016906536464856264
and yet, i have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. 0.016241925417280284
for that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. 0.028610713594879558
in fact, i don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? 0.11939514264497722
well no faithless helen, no odyssey.  0.043472087194499145
no jealous king, no arabian nights.  0.10212149527580384
no shakespeare. 0.05501080739920602
there goes high school reading lists, because we're losing sound and the fury, we're losing gatsby, sun also rises, we're losing madame bovary, anna k.  0.004453765026369045
no jealousy, no proust. and now, i mean, i know it's fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. 0.01164069729160941
this year is the centennial of his masterpiece, in search of lost time, and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. 0.010569223575148797
and we think about proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? 0.018798317647335087
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. 0.020255986027125642
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. 0.010182425646195498
we forget how harsh his vision was. 0.02163211878762423
we forget how pitiless he is. 0.02151810250197126
i mean, these are books that virginia woolf said were tough as cat gut. 0.012603820262803964
i don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable. 0.10074708078532289
let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and proust. 0.011328360454400999
is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? 0.01542345413162388
i don't know. i think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. 0.12140469093985637
when we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. 0.024808415001701823
we tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. 0.01578553134144601
as the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. right? 0.006909792747415067
jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something proust understood. 0.060905111119656574
in the first volume, swann's way, the series of books, swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, hang on, everything i love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. 0.011843220132847793
everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now.  0.00967763449717078
and this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, proust writes that every fresh charm swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.  0.007567143835953721
now swann and proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. 0.006716472052354862
you know, proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. 0.017860092878992276
but you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. right? 0.013596634387289886
jealousy is exhausting. 0.0823481567964712
it's a hungry emotion. it must be fed. 0.028240990488565418
and what does jealousy like? 0.040824829046386304
jealousy likes information. 0.05372849659117709
jealousy likes details. 0.05795053470733952
jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. 0.012285946074705657
jealousy likes photos. 0.048549177170732344
that's why instagram is such a hit. 0.0670144447096575
proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. 0.0169861974906263
when swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. 0.00601792799310401
he says, you know, look, i know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.  0.02506944938143526
he says, they are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.  0.03707609241841854
proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. 0.026029390449536335
grief, humiliation, loss: these were the avenues to wisdom for proust. 0.0320149011251689
he says, a woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.  0.0047858819807434635
is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? 0.017395797375642234
no. i think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. 0.13520459769143478
and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? 0.015138514598766055
does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? 0.013357103092090346
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity? 0.008282282660969604
freud would write about this later. 0.018850319022747353
one day, freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. 0.014084041646526073
and freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. 0.03709091243806321
because she's blameless; everybody knows it. 0.025124218547395095
the poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. 0.03155984539112946
but he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. 0.03312498979466406
is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? 0.02560744480557418
[freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. 0.018798317647335087
the novel is very good on this point. 0.03455747170954952
the novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. 0.016041048674590542
in fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. 0.06518963777667167
and this is why, i think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. 0.016373682488441264
jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. 0.01340082578177889
now i'm thinking of myself at eight, i concede, but i'm also thinking of this story i heard on the news. 0.04595331932733298
a 52-year-old michigan woman was caught creating a fake facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. 0.007920038643543535
for a year. a year. 0.028517539529041507
and she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and i have to confess when i heard this, i just reacted with admiration. 0.028610713594879544
because, i mean, let's be real. 0.32466791547509893
what immense, if misplaced, creativity. right? 0.024808415001701823
this is something from a novel. 0.039281465090051315
this is something from a patricia highsmith novel. 0.02777619034011792
now highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. 0.018850319022747353
she is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters. 0.017395797375642234
she's the author of strangers on a train and the talented mr. ripley, books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. 0.024165196107975555
take tom ripley, her most famous character. 0.013679192123121896
now, tom ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. 0.00978862062356798
that's one way to go. 0.05795053470733952
but what do we do? we can't go the tom ripley route. 0.011818473926491593
i can't give the world d's, as much as i would really like to, some days. 0.02191286020886785
and it's a pity, because we live in envious times. 0.03975360176263952
we live in jealous times. 0.043472087194499145
i mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy? 0.02814392937863503
does the novel show us a way out? i'm not sure. 0.018760191497604554
so let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. 0.02898497051727735
let's go to 221b baker street and ask for sherlock holmes. 0.009629943614188135
when people think of holmes, they think of his nemesis being professor moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. 0.007511251053510192
but i've always preferred [inspector] lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of scotland yard who needs holmes desperately, needs holmes' genius, but resents him. 0.01012090815331229
oh, it's so familiar to me. 0.018850319022747353
so lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. 0.007920038643543535
but as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in the adventure of the six napoleons, once holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, lestrade turns to holmes and he says, we're not jealous of you, mr. holmes. 0.007567143835953721
we're proud of you.  0.0808764862779457
and he says that there's not a man at scotland yard who wouldn't want to shake sherlock holmes' hand. 0.023705266435224467
it's one of the few times we see holmes moved in the mysteries, and i find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? 0.028626251147893356
it seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. 0.028176690232541168
you know, one minute holmes is on the other side from lestrade. 0.019765441873349214
the next minute they're on the same side. 0.025518615589394285
suddenly, lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. 0.00956240657444202
could it be so simple though? 0.0439891724758422
what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? 0.011842354018539858
well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. 0.06770149544242768
we could align ourselves with it. 0.023980296761827107
but i like contingency plans. 0.03303164318013808
so while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. 0.015492053781622543
fiction alone demystifies jealousy. 0.023980296761827107
fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. 0.01428363257865929
and look who it gathers: sweet lestrade, terrifying tom ripley, crazy swann, marcel proust himself. 0.023017423600862546
we are in excellent company. 0.06500593260343691
thank you. 0.316227766016838
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state. 0
it was a beautiful day. 0.040824829046386304
the forest was sparkling. 0.07071067811865477
the sun made the leaves glow like stained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were following, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land. 0.01083288946290837
we got to our campsite. 0.048549177170732344
it was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal, beautiful lake, when i discovered a horror. 0.006409912521492096
behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker. 0
and i was astonished, i was very angry, and i was deeply confused. 0.01340082578177889
the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them? 0.010526316597195988
that question stayed with me, and it simplified a little. 0.03592143420342892
who cleans up after us? 0.014628063653657535
however you configure or wherever you place the us, who cleans up after us in istanbul? 0.010438074937942448
who cleans up after us in rio or in paris or in london? 0.009410489957951634
here in new york, the department of sanitation cleans up after us, to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day. 0.007574421758634933
i wanted to get to know them as individuals. 0.03155984539112946
i wanted to understand who takes the job. 0.024925978674400287
what's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden? 0.03592143420342892
so i started a research project with them. 0.02777619034011792
i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and i learned a lot, but i was still an outsider. 0.01505058590607595
i needed to go deeper. 0.037951271263104894
so i took the job as a sanitation worker. 0.024808415001701823
i didn't just ride in the trucks now. i drove the trucks. 0.051424016050282635
and i operated the mechanical brooms and i plowed the snow. 0.020255986027125642
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education. 0.024088562704853513
everyone asks about the smell. 0.024822529802838878
it's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly. 0.017212856117174328
the weight takes a long time to get used to. 0.018850319022747353
i knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week. 0.007511251053510192
then there's the danger. 0.1561969968460128
according to the bureau of labor statistics, sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country, and i learned why. 0.006659932104026654
you're in and out of traffic all day, and it's zooming around you. 0.021118740211640723
it just wants to get past you, so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. 0.01618861356572822
that's really bad for the worker. 0.039281465090051315
and then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm. 0.024635236830568785
i also learned about the relentlessness of trash. 0.021105340631872645
when you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. 0.016474575791240956
it never stops coming. 0.06389431042462725
it's also like a form of respiration or circulation. 0.03592143420342892
it must always be in motion. 0.02777619034011792
and then there's the stigma. 0.1561969968460128
you put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. 0.025045361270148
i find the stigma especially ironic, because i strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons. 0.011843220132847793
they are the first guardians of public health. 0.04740604259878138
if they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its containments, and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. 0.006659932104026654
diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. 0.005495155913866061
the economy needs them. 0.040824829046386304
if we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. 0.09952498083578393
i'm not advocating capitalism, i'm just pointing out their relationship. 0.05186805880190237
and then there's what i call our average, necessary quotidian velocity. 0.13102495978815187
by that i simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. 0.00956240657444202
we usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water. 0.019454290935168924
we use them, we throw them out, we forget about them, because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away. 0.0607943136604975
so i want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. 0.00502727015690302
their work, i think, is kind of liturgical. 0.10156297514737136
they're on the streets every day, rhythmically. 0.03975360176263952
they wear a uniform in many cities. 0.0346657712709552
you know when to expect them. 0.03501806396568503
and their work lets us do our work. 0.018798317647335087
they are almost a form of reassurance. 0.07201170728284921
the flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what. 0.012342434672334951
on the day after september 11 in 2001, i heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street, and i grabbed my infant son and i ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every wednesday. 0.010423357040347159
and i tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but i started to cry. 0.02945288437401947
and he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said, we're going to be okay. 0.10640850690356463
we're going to be okay.  0.040824829046386304
it was a little while later that i started my research with sanitation, and i met that man again. 0.022261720385938513
his name is paulie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends. 0.026774751589863543
i want to believe that paulie was right. 0.02777619034011792
we are going to be okay. 0.04873039689743777
but in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor. 0.004453765026369045
and we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the united states and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. 0.012646071698454286
municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage, accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. 0.00439603664946057
it's a remarkable statistic. 0.07440995947486906
so in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. 0.007119802576104629
take a moment to say thank you. 0.037951271263104894
hello, tedwomen, what's up. 0.041095991233501536
not good enough. 0.03336574130316504
hello, tedwomen, what is up? 0.03655552228545124
my name is maysoon zayid, and i am not drunk, but the doctor who delivered me was. 0.170595737016168
he cut my mom six different times in six different directions, suffocating poor little me in the process. 0.025088052144206233
as a result, i have cerebral palsy, which means i shake all the time. 0.02560744480557418
look. 0.1495348781221221
it's exhausting. i'm like shakira, shakira meets muhammad ali. 0.03825655967767164
c.p. is not genetic. 0.04282963710525157
it's not a birth defect. you can't catch it. 0.03809096946542823
no one put a curse on my mother's uterus, and i didn't get it because my parents are first cousins, which they are. 0.03946524550197028
it only happens from accidents, like what happened to me on my birth day. 0.014216645907653848
now, i must warn you, i'm not inspirational, and i don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dreamt of being disabled. 0.0695595144867064
come on a journey with me. 0.08034284189446518
it's christmas eve, you're at the mall, you're driving around in circles looking for parking, and what do you see? 0.03493216971413917
sixteen empty handicapped spaces. 0.03455747170954952
and you're like, god, can't i just be a little disabled?  0.03139908860405026
also, i gotta tell you, i got 99 problems, and palsy is just one. 0.012322506848565618
if there was an oppression olympics, i would win the gold medal. 0.028927969316143217
i'm palestinian, muslim, i'm female, i'm disabled, and i live in new jersey. 0.0897260545159216
if you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should. 0.012673718536830811
cliffside park, new jersey is my hometown. 0.024808415001701823
i have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials. 0.017200673466668964
i also love the fact that if i wanted to walk from my house to new york city, i could. 0.01806193387447607
a lot of people with c.p. don't walk, but my parents didn't believe in can't.  0.030300084770800907
my father's mantra was, you can do it, yes you can can.  0.013713605456973251
so, if my three older sisters were mopping, i was mopping. 0.03201406061582137
if my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that i went too, and if we didn't all get a's, we all got my mother's slipper. 0.011019978611354831
my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking. 0.007156562786973337
another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it. 0.005484236895303142
my inner stripper was very strong, and by -- yeah. no, by the first day of kindergarten, i was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times. 0.011003640569973154
growing up, there were only six arabs in my town, and they were all my family. 0.016275776313613193
now there are 20 arabs in town, and they are still all my family. 0.1903289244293778
i don't think anyone even noticed we weren't italian. 0.022023814946586635
this was before 9 11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use i hate moslems as a campaign slogan. 0.00284570245153172
the people that i grew up with had no problem with my faith. 0.0169861974906263
they did, however, seem very concerned that i would starve to death during ramadan. 0.016906536464856264
i would explain to them that i have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake. 0.004255317692616196
i have tap-danced on broadway. 0.039281465090051315
yeah, on broadway. it's crazy. 0.07201170728284921
my parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dancing school. 0.014325118498890291
i learned how to dance in heels, which means i can walk in heels. 0.025704217748383898
and i'm from jersey, and we are really concerned with being chic, so if my friends wore heels, so did i. 0.013565907333537271
and when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the jersey shore, i did not. 0.012990806323574158
i spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to palestine every single summer, we'd grow up to be madonna. 0.018535641208333595
summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so i drank deer's milk, i had hot cups on my back, i was dunked in the dead sea, and i remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, it's working! it's working!  0.022488248919237203
but one miracle cure we did find was yoga. 0.022023814946586635
i have to tell you, it's very boring, but before i did yoga, i was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up. 0.02323249892661418
and now i can stand on my head. 0.06846046760764757
my parents reinforced this notion that i could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera general hospital.  0.015395110159015185
i went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to asu, arizona state university, because i fit every single quota. 0.01919576709993771
i was like the pet lemur of the theater department. 0.04939382737115371
everybody loved me. 0.05833544737207805
i did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework, i got a's in all of my classes, a's in all of their classes. 0.018041089138224272
every time i did a scene from the glass menagerie, my professors would weep. 0.007205335066302803
but i never got cast. 0.06846046760764757
finally, my senior year, asu decided to do a show called they dance real slow in jackson.  0.0037451550450560973
it's a play about a girl with c.p. 0.02054901307230194
i was a girl with c.p. 0.05062667121584364
so i start shouting from the rooftops, i'm finally going to get a part! 0.05415315253510895
i have cerebral palsy! 0
free at last! free at last! 0
thank god almighty, i'm free at last!  0.10620315618312248
i didn't get the part. 0.046713797772820004
sherry brown got the part. 0.023980296761827107
i went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat, to ask her why, and she said it was because they didn't think i could do the stunts. 0.02970085895994595
i said, excuse me, if i can't do the stunts, neither can the character.  0.06941681530093603
this was a part that i was literally born to play and they gave it, they gave it to a non-palsy actress. 0.00366753025392797
college was imitating life. 0.023980296761827107
hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen. 0.005355924989097696
upon graduating, i moved back home, and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera. 0.012041494936658497
my dream was coming true. 0.028517539529041507
and i knew that i would be promoted from diner diner to wacky best friend in no time. 0.01054040505861668
but instead, i remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head, and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors. 0.019489251419289165
they only hired perfect people. 0.03849815007763549
but there were exceptions to the rule. 0.03342866121562732
i grew up watching whoopi goldberg, roseanne barr, ellen, and all of these women had one thing in common: they were comedians. 0.007156562786973337
so i became a comic. 0.10266900960803409
my first gig was driving famous comics from new york city to shows in new jersey, and i'll never forget the face of the first comic i ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the new jersey turnpike with a chick with c.p. driving him. 0.003384129602542209
i've performed in clubs all over america, and i've also performed in arabic in the middle east, uncensored and uncovered. 0.03815225843185609
some people say i'm the first stand-up comic in the arab world. 0.04231178541610579
i never like to claim first, but i do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny, and they find us hysterical. 0.04809089118277273
in 2003, my brother from another mother and father dean obeidallah and i started the new york arab-american comedy festival, now in its 10th year. 0.007920038643543535
our goal was to change the negative image of arab-americans in media, while also reminding casting directors that south asian and arab are not synonymous. 0.011562497201211533
mainstreaming arabs was much, much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability. 0.02499302941518757
my big break came in 2010. 0.023980296761827107
i was invited to be a guest on the cable news show countdown with keith olbermann.  0.012109013026441871
i walked in looking like i was going to the prom, and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair. 0.01806282823007299
so i looked at the stage manager and i'm like, excuse me, can i have another chair?  0.024021176907323107
and she looked at me and she went, five, four, three, two ...  0.015663840573309693
and we were live, right? 0.03155984539112946
so i had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that i wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment, and when the interview was over, i was livid. 0.01070155744123372
i had finally gotten my chance and i blew it, and i knew i would never get invited back. 0.045298051905638646
but not only did mr. olbermann invite me back, he made me a full-time contributor, and he taped down my chair. 0.020718273217023204
one fun fact i learned while on the air with keith olbermann was that humans on the internet are scumbags. 0.005508606419495829
people say children are cruel, but i was never made fun of as a child or an adult. 0.019933673568014454
suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game. 0.024218026052883736
i would look at clips online and see comments like, yo, why's she tweakin?  0.025717247215323175
 yo, is she retarded?  0.0439891724758422
and my favorite, poor gumby-mouth terrorist. 0.022416933501922302
what does she suffer from? 0.040824829046386304
we should really pray for her.  0.018850319022747353
one commenter even suggested that i add my disability to my credits: screenwriter, comedian, palsy. 0.012740810460323604
disability is as visual as race. 0.03266828640925502
if a wheelchair user can't play beyoncé, then beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user. 0.014143371354519225
the disabled are the largest yeah, clap for that, man. c'mon. 0.017395797375642234
people with disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment. 0.11888637751962024
the doctors said that i wouldn't walk, but i am here in front of you. 0.09661884164171465
however, if i grew up with social media, i don't think i would be. 0.06729289805408342
i hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life. 0.012322506848565618
perhaps if there were more positive images, it would foster less hate on the internet. 0.005508606419495829
or maybe not. 0.1880301546543197
maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well. 0.020200106912694155
my crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places. 0.012109013026441871
i got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva susan lucci and the iconic lorraine arbus. 0.02191286020886785
i got to act in a movie with adam sandler and work with my idol, the amazing dave matthews. 0.009498525867740094
i toured the world as a headliner on arabs gone wild. 0.03266996347141534
i was a delegate representing the great state of new jersey at the 2008 dnc. 0.013458287311995505
and i founded maysoon's kids, a charity that hopes to give palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me. 0.016237908184412748
but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got -- before this moment -- but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, has parkinson's and shakes just like me, muhammad ali. 0.012219662673429317
it was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live, and i dedicate this talk to his memory. 0.026994027705122554
my name is maysoon zayid, and if i can can, you can can. 0.018271220681322326
so, we used to solve big problems. 0.04469338322542863
on july 21st, 1969, buzz aldrin climbed out of apollo 11's lunar module and descended onto the sea of tranquility. 0.004286566854494811
armstrong and aldrin were alone, but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort. 0.007156562786973337
the apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the united states. 0.015119292037773728
to get to the moon, nasa spent around 180 billion dollars in today's money, or four percent of the federal budget. 0.009188355573937162
apollo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies. 0.010713701843513142
people died, including the crew of apollo 1. 0.0428361950754725
but before the apollo program ended, 24 men flew to the moon. 0.008517399705356638
twelve walked on its surface, of whom aldrin, following the death of armstrong last year, is now the most senior. 0.009188355573937162
so why did they go? 0.041095991233501536
they didn't bring much back: 841 pounds of old rocks, and something all 24 later emphasized -- a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home. 0.01070155744123372
why did they go? the cynical answer is they went because president kennedy wanted to show the soviets that his nation had the better rockets. 0.00284570245153172
but kennedy's own words at rice university in 1962 provide a better clue. 0.007939087147543497
to contemporaries, apollo wasn't only a victory of west over east in the cold war. 0.012972311972961765
at the time, the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology. 0.028460812517661596
they went because it was a big thing to do. 0.03592143420342892
landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs. 0.015138514598766055
the first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. 0.023333784658311877
in the middle years of the century, polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated. 0.01332691735545882
technology itself seemed to possess what alvin toffler in 1970 called accelerative thrust.  0.01520779505248453
for most of human history, we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail, but in 1969, the crew of apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour. 0.012025643116608276
since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon. 0.020255986027125642
no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo 10, and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve, such as going to mars, creating clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard. 0.00978862062356798
i remember watching the liftoff of apollo 17. 0.02777619034011792
i was five years old, and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a saturn v rocket. 0.015721757597198516
i vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions, but i was absolutely certain there would be mars colonies in my lifetime. 0.007567143835953721
so something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology has become a commonplace. 0.007939087147543497
you hear it all the time. 0.036015288308423515
we've heard it over the last two days here at ted. 0.005648892151960285
it feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys, with things like iphones and apps and social media, or algorithms that speed automated trading. 0.009215897997772978
there's nothing wrong with most of these things. 0.016847111051295396
they've expanded and enriched our lives. 0.026658376817028855
but they don't solve humanity's big problems. 0.023233421968350106
what happened? 0.05501080739920602
so there is a parochial explanation in silicon valley, which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed intel, microsoft, apple and genentech. 0.016748842534043438
silicon valley says the markets are to blame, in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs. 0.005919382824640357
silicon valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems. 0.006651640607160381
but i don't think that explanation is good enough. 0.09144626892372869
it mostly explains what's wrong with silicon valley. 0.013217947626377298
even when venture capitalists were at their most risk-happy, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years. 0.003384129602542209
v.c.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy, and v.c.s have never, never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value. 0.004928901229276252
no, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound. 0.022023814946586635
sometimes we choose not to solve big problems. 0.036362270465000714
we could go to mars if we want. 0.0169861974906263
nasa even has the outline of a plan. 0.024808415001701823
but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal, and that will never happen. 0.014123416972389431
we won't go to mars, because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on earth. 0.04642919375465767
sometimes, we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail. 0.017239238102071234
today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption derives from advanced, renewable sources such as solar, wind and biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason is purely economic. 0.008231215992636891
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels. 0.021729983079834318
we want alternative energy sources that can compete on price. none exist. 0.013323934178453772
now, technologists, business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy: mostly, a significant increase in energy research and development, and some kind of price on carbon. 0.010423357040347159
but there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see u.s. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus. 0.007249733756281732
sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so. 0.03536389861883236
famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply. 0.006510755202591488
but 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution. 0.015331320282974655
technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food, but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments. 0.01728874123127798
finally, big problems sometimes elude solution because we don't really understand the problem. 0.016237908184412748
president nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer, most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective, viable therapies have come to seem real. 0.008998901289965153
hard problems are hard. 0.05372849659117709
it's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology. 0.011712916466550741
we can, we must, but these four elements must all be present: political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem; institutions must support its solution; it must really be a technological problem; and we must understand it. 0.00978862062356798
the apollo mission, which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems, met these criteria. 0.01500243980428485
but it is an irreproducible model for the future. 0.13036420666577953
it is not 1961. 0.0417991745584234
there is no galvanizing contest like the cold war, no politician like john kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system. 0.012646071698454286
most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy. 0.01714632199160149
it was just three days away. 0.020255986027125642
and arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem. 0.02434178296655151
we are left alone with our day, and the solutions of the future will be harder won. 0.006081389695809871
god knows, we don't lack for the challenges. 0.023830412565256146
thank you very much. 0.10785809837243004
i'd like to invite you to close your eyes. 0.004635487482440636
imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home. 0.021105340631872645
i'd like you to notice the color of the door, the material that it's made out of. 0.029452743654800276
now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles. 0.02054901307230194
they are competing in a naked bicycle race, and they are headed straight for your front door. 0.05667859235210572
i need you to actually see this. 0.03880684294761699
they are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty, they're bouncing around a lot. 0.03807134866446317
and they crash straight into the front door of your home. 0.05464286595434615
bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you, spokes end up in awkward places. 0.026510050122865468
step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway, whatever's on the other side, and appreciate the quality of the light. 0.02146295243791772
the light is shining down on cookie monster. 0.028517539529041507
cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse. 0.02297185935845028
it's a talking horse. 0.11404605374835301
you can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose. 0.036362270465000714
you can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth. 0.011326402345230238
walk past him. walk past him into your living room. 0.011433361115787456
in your living room, in full imaginative broadband, picture britney spears. 0.01618861356572822
she is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table, and she's singing hit me baby one more time.  0.016041048674590542
and then follow me into your kitchen. 0.03303164318013808
in your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road and out of your oven are coming towards you dorothy, the tin man, the scarecrow and the lion from the wizard of oz, hand-in-hand skipping straight towards you. 0.00978862062356798
okay. open your eyes. 0.06257106818159155
i want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in new york city. 0.042084990495118005
it's called the united states memory championship. 0.028319415510892395
and i had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist expecting, i guess, that this was going to be like the superbowl of savants. 0.026912992152558907
this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies, widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep. 0.009490012376346203
they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once. 0.018515655955607467
they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers. 0.012673718536830811
they were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes. 0.015138514598766055
they were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest. 0.012285946074705657
i was like, this is unbelievable. 0.037684991644924185
these people must be freaks of nature. 0.06804621483119704
and i started talking to a few of the competitors. 0.22416933501922293
this is a guy called ed cook who had come over from england where he had one of the best trained memories. 0.009410489957951634
and i said to him, ed, when did you realize that you were a savant?  0.03187271473320672
and ed was like, i'm not a savant. 0.08609583710384033
in fact, i have just an average memory. 0.09578464408619825
everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory. 0.011191021613657745
we've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques, techniques invented 2,500 years ago in greece, the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches, that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books.  0.003384129602542209
and i was like, whoa. how come i never heard of this before?  0.03170669928057299
and we were standing outside the competition hall, and ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric english guy, says to me, josh, you're an american journalist. 0.01120062606421828
do you know britney spears?  0.05372849659117709
i'm like, what? no. why?  0.043472087194499145
 because i really want to teach britney spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on u.s. national television. 0.015514392335273455
it will prove to the world that anybody can do this.  0.021359012567909896
i was like, well i'm not britney spears, but maybe you could teach me. 0.0708606244724358
i mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?  0.21586404366478298
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me. 0.0204689180374571
i ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory, but also investigating it, trying to understand how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work and what its potential might be. 0.01120062606421828
i met a host of really interesting people. 0.022416933501922302
this is a guy called e.p. 0.039281465090051315
he's an amnesic who had, very possibly, the very worst memory in the world. 0.023956565612760213
his memory was so bad that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem, which is amazing. 0.017448767890681335
and he was this incredibly tragic figure, but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are. 0.014782064491589643
the other end of the spectrum: i met this guy. 0.020255986027125642
this is kim peek. 0.09554427922043669
he was the basis for dustin hoffman's character in the movie rain man.  0.016153228406487214
we spent an afternoon together in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books, which was scintillating. 0.007920038643543535
and i went back and i read a whole host of memory treatises, treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in latin in antiquity and then later in the middle ages. 0.007920038643543535
and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff. 0.021972813874997166
one of the really interesting things that i learned is that once upon a time, this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today. 0.005091894897311005
once upon a time, people invested in their memories, in laboriously furnishing their minds. 0.012673718536830811
over the last few millenia we've invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the scroll to the codex, the printing press, photography, the computer, the smartphone -- that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories, for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. 0.008231215992636891
these technologies have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us. 0.01296247288049188
they've changed us culturally, and i would argue that they've changed us cognitively. 0.02872495348091206
having little need to remember anymore, it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how. 0.01801210737536247
one of the last places on earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest. 0.01209685959137829
it's actually not that singular, there are contests held all over the world. 0.05587443695709437
and i was fascinated, i wanted to know how do these guys do it. 0.02297185935845028
a few years back a group of researchers at university college london brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab. 0.003384129602542209
they wanted to know: do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally, anatomically different from the rest of ours? 0.010884267615693714
the answer was no. 0.09554427922043669
are they smarter than the rest of us? 0.029519129053903102
they gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was not really. 0.035616947681547155
there was however one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to. 0.011649284259158212
when they put these guys in an fmri machine, scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes, they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else. 0.008231215992636891
of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using, a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation. 0.014496451719022625
why? and is there something the rest of us can learn from this? 0.018445540119318492
the sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly, and then the rest of the field has to play catchup. 0.004928901229276252
this is my friend ben pridmore, three-time world memory champion. 0.021359012567909896
on his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour, using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered. 0.015134287671907443
he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits in half an hour. 0.011191021613657745
yeah. 0.1495348781221221
and while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions, everything, all of the techniques that are being used, ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding. 0.022042716406087945
and it's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker baker paradox, which goes like this: if i tell two people to remember the same word, if i say to you, remember that there is a guy named baker.  0.02106055451080167
that's his name. 0.09554427922043669
and i say to you, remember that there is a guy who is a baker.  0.019251614434393566
and i come back to you at some point later on, and i say, do you remember that word that i told you a while back? 0.05085570764977474
do you remember what it was?  0.048549177170732344
the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker. 0.009500266321476485
same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird. 0.017395797375642234
what's going on here? 0.06389431042462725
well the name baker doesn't actually mean anything to you. 0.032709344708772174
it is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull. 0.06087895024805787
but the common noun baker, we know bakers. 0.039073802494525016
bakers wear funny white hats. 0.022416933501922302
bakers have flour on their hands. 0.028319415510892395
bakers smell good when they come home from work. 0.013679192123121896
maybe we even know a baker. 0.06985342056580097
and when we first hear that word, we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date. 0.03330914317374546
the entire art of what is going on in these memory contests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life is figuring out ways to transform capital b bakers into lower-case b bakers -- to take information that is lacking in context, in significance, in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind. 0.0037451550450560973
one of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2,500 years to ancient greece. 0.01284618972676772
it came to be known as the memory palace. 0.013217947626377298
the story behind its creation goes like this: there was a poet called simonides who was attending a banquet. 0.048746715608426264
he was actually the hired entertainment, because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party, you didn't hire a d.j., you hired a poet. 0.021367689804137186
and he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door, and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses, kills everybody inside. 0.01012090815331229
it doesn't just kill everybody, it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition. 0.02544908849416925
nobody can say who was inside, nobody can say where they were sitting. 0.030185197980400025
the bodies can't be properly buried. 0.02777619034011792
it's one tragedy compounding another. 0.039281465090051315
simonides, standing outside, the sole survivor amid the wreckage, closes his eyes and has this realization, which is that in his mind's eye, he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting. 0.007920038643543535
and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage. 0.013722599955986394
what simonides figured out at that moment is something that i think we all kind of intuitively know, which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues, we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories. 0.10095510442093915
if i asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story that i just told you about simonides, chances are you would have a tough time with it. 0.014538040525630739
but i would wager that if i asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now, you would be able to see that. 0.01642092444821043
the idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be. 0.009958921354772334
this is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years to the earliest latin memory treatises. 0.006369304104455854
so how does this work? 0.05789300674674099
let's say that you've been invited to ted center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory, and you want to do it the way that cicero would have done it if he had been invited to tedxrome 2,000 years ago. 0.027717248490035467
what you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house. 0.1479257593879102
and you'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest. 0.02565954567470183
and then you'd go inside your house, and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed. 0.052375457848575946
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook. 0.030064545690526145
and then you'd see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell. 0.01871980086991623
and you go into your kitchen, and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year, and you have some friends to help you remember that. 0.03209168697731788
this is how roman orators memorized their speeches -- not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up, but topic-for-topic. 0.019454290935168924
in fact, the phrase topic sentence, that comes from the greek word topos, which means place.  0.04934494673001858
that's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms. 0.009020544569112136
the phrase in the first place, that's like in the first place of your memory palace. 0.03370129264673146
i thought this was just fascinating, and i got really into it. 0.07239768078888709
and i went to a few more of these memory contests. 0.10120193244194395
and i had this notion that i might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers. 0.011326402345230238
but there was a problem. 0.274941620352113
the problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event. 0.03975360176263952
truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the sats. 0.036787632499277766
i mean, the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples. 0.01524900926541044
and i'm a journalist, i need something to write about. 0.06770149544242768
i know that there's this incredible stuff happening in these people's minds, but i don't have access to it. 0.040931410461557835
and i realized, if i was going to tell this story, i needed to walk in their shoes a little bit. 0.03096815816279625
and so i started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times just trying to remember something. 0.008667842943607578
maybe it was a poem. 0.07440995947486906
maybe it was names from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market. 0.01284618972676772
and i found that this was shockingly fun. 0.04740604259878138
i never would have expected that. 0.05795053470733952
it was fun because this is actually not about training your memory. 0.018445540119318492
what you're doing is you're trying to get better and better and better at creating, at dreaming up, these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye. 0.017997802579930305
and i got pretty into it. 0.07415543676501504
this is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit. 0.0223550930962921
it's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes, because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy. 0.007920038643543535
i ended up coming back to that same contest that i had covered a year earlier. 0.02560744480557418
and i had this notion that i might enter it, sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism. 0.014577516118523641
it'd make, i thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research. 0.0169861974906263
problem was the experiment went haywire. 0.034052233956373766
i won the contest, which really wasn't supposed to happen. 0.036260056295236785
now it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists, but it's actually kind of beside the point. 0.01010538574534253
these are just tricks. 0.037951271263104894
they are tricks that work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work. 0.01286057341226582
and you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works. 0.044589955286594034
we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift, but that is not the case. 0.014098910172549634
great memories are learned. 0.02925226826055808
at the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention. 0.018272664875356538
we remember when we are deeply engaged. 0.025098621243978974
we remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us, why it is significant, why it's colorful, when we're able to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds, when we're able to transform bakers into bakers. 0.0052964490579083525
the memory palace, these memory techniques, they're just shortcuts. 0.020008008009612506
in fact, they're not even really shortcuts. 0.14734754237051595
they work because they make you work. 0.037684991644924185
they force a kind of depth of processing, a kind of mindfulness, that most of us don't normally walk around exercising. 0.021755494215007404
but there actually are no shortcuts. 0.039281465090051315
this is how stuff is made memorable. 0.033031643180138064
and i think if there's one thing that i want to leave you with, it's what e.p., the amnesic who couldn't even remember that he had a memory problem, left me with, which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories. 0.0669298489134112
how much are we willing to lose from our already short lives by losing ourselves in our blackberries, our iphones, by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us, by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply? 0.005504545893242798
i learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us. 0.05750551296762978
but if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember. 0.044147681940077975
thank you. 0.316227766016838
when i was 27 years old, i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching. 0.006659932104026654
i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools. 0.028381604237767786
and like any teacher, i made quizzes and tests. 0.03834034153732051
i gave out homework assignments. 0.07201170728284921
when the work came back, i calculated grades. 0.039073802494525016
what struck me was that i.q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. 0.01173952178607745
some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric i.q. scores. 0.018839576731405495
some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. 0.018618937187482525
and that got me thinking. 0.035065941041239286
the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. 0.01387195318363841
but these concepts are not impossible, and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. 0.01737720878556081
after several more years of teaching, i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. 0.012395530354594541
in education, the one thing we know how to measure best is i.q., but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? 0.019445724895759763
so i left the classroom, and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist. 0.12436722085116984
i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? 0.02345835275962975
my research team and i went to west point military academy. 0.03707609241841854
we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. 0.0151463165231073
we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. 0.00601792799310401
we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? 0.012882549225328634
we partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? 0.012384901282810543
and who's going to earn the most money? 0.03478700554542394
in all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. 0.013659149296955463
and it wasn't social intelligence. 0.045480190470279055
it wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't i.q. 0.03201406061582137
it was grit. 0.08034284189446518
grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. 0.015672155411163936
grit is having stamina. 0.035065941041239286
grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. 0.012128803860889928
grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. 0.030119166060089728
a few years ago, i started studying grit in the chicago public schools. 0.14598608091257087
i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. 0.003384129602542209
turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when i matched them on every characteristic i could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. 0.00960893655979421
so it's not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters. it's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. 0.005182480292886744
to me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it. 0.012067947296968109
every day, parents and teachers ask me, how do i build grit in kids? 0.013670263578541062
what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic? 0.01706602014357155
how do i keep them motivated for the long run?  0.04809182765844818
the honest answer is, i don't know. 0.3264971028628052
what i do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. 0.025510012742866274
our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. 0.021084454569051277
in fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. 0.0233993960784673
so far, the best idea i've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset.  0.01173952178607745
this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. 0.02673219555880807
dr. dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. 0.008998901289965153
so growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. 0.021155197015459558
but we need more. 0.07730551756939454
and that's where i'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. 0.08797919867908399
that's the work that stands before us. 0.06985342056580097
we need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. 0.050661968099322066
we need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. 0.08627614350932425
in other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. 0.14639350349026062
thank you. 0.316227766016838
my work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions. 0.007567143835953721
today i brought two recent projects as an example of this. 0.01553712569276035
both projects are in emerging countries, one in ethiopia and another one in tunisia. 0.02437335780421313
and also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture. 0.016604746091696276
the first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in ethiopia's capital city addis ababa. 0.008830895300928163
and this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design. 0.008792073298921142
at first, the first thing i thought was, i want to run away. 0.015276780223747026
after seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points. 0.022095731396358693
first, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. 0.021534950847707728
second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling. 0.029042744396966903
in a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. 0.00825101291002796
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia. 0.010331208012220438
it is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions. 0.008186841244220632
also during our first visit to ethiopia, i was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vendors. 0.004928901229276252
and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. 0.012384901282810543
so i thought, this is what i really want to design, not a shopping mall. 0.146798691397542
but the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles. 0.02818299888381893
the next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there. 0.010848650703274672
and it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters. 0.019427446513842185
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building. 0.14529580795237468
and this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. 0.015436464226810553
and around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void. 0.020588815727980117
i also thought, how to close the building? 0.022710171642664416
and i really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. 0.026920508809559315
and i started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way. 0.01390432068625059
and then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the ethiopian women's dresses. 0.027166383723579154
that they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. 0.006510755202591488
and we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. 0.008231215992636891
and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night. 0.009188355573937162
with these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, this is not a shopping mall. we didn't ask for that.  0.01170925172080782
but then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. 0.011692093421606195
and also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. 0.015975311320580363
so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project. 0.07266233607408884
and the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. 0.0266785298043081
so we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. 0.017395797375642234
and then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. 0.008510635385232392
and these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. 0.012285946074705657
hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction. 0.011371681934875243
the second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of tunis. 0.027854685173648884
and for doing such a big project, the biggest project i've ever designed, i really needed to understand the city of tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture. 0.008231215992636891
during that analysis i paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines. 0.004255317692616196
when i went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in barcelona and other cities in europe with these courtyards. 0.028806255791322094
on top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern. 0.017997802579930305
and the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan. 0.008998901289965153
and for that i thought, what would be the best orientation in the mediterranean climate for an apartment? 0.011328360454400999
and it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. 0.016604746091696276
so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction. 0.020086936595190463
and this is the result that is almost like a combination of the european block and the arab city. 0.019427446513842185
it has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. 0.0500477701316162
and also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. 0.007678432706586176
and it also reinforces this idea of the gates. 0.025098621243978974
the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor. 0.004453765026369045
the roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. 0.009131246806741877
and it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another. 0.016120076571734802
these two examples, they have a common approach in the design process. 0.021359012567909896
and also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. 0.06740258529346294
in these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. 0.015037307654842394
for this reason, i see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people. 0.020320426781099656
thank you very much. 0.10785809837243004
so i'm going to talk about trust, and i'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust. 0.11078427167692374
i think these are so commonplace, they've become clichés of our society. 0.026921215590856643
and i think there are three. 0.06376715693797415
one's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust, very widely believed. 0.08968235248346601
the second is an aim: we should have more trust. 0.039524926351130286
and the third is a task: we should rebuild trust. 0.0223550930962921
i think that the claim, the aim and the task are all misconceived. 0.0756083295989952
so what i'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task which i think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter. 0.014906383786801687
first the claim: why do people think trust has declined? 0.0361808203044872
and if i really think about it on the basis of my own evidence, i don't know the answer. 0.05085570764977474
i'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others. 0.009795841373797659
i don't have an overview. 0.03155984539112946
but, of course, i can look at the opinion polls, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined. 0.057773581215517136
when you actually look at opinion polls across time, there's not much evidence for that. 0.01810475702107434
that's to say, the people who were mistrusted 20 years ago, principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted. 0.02501418024138638
and the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses. 0.011326402345230238
the rest of us are in between, and by the way, the average person in the street is almost exactly midway. 0.019961414923815222
but is that good evidence? 0.04049515890265692
what opinion polls record is, of course, opinions. 0.020200106912694155
what else can they record? 0.039281465090051315
so they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions. 0.024218026052883736
do you trust politicians? do you trust teachers? 0.02151810250197126
now if somebody said to you, do you trust greengrocers? 0.009498525867740094
do you trust fishmongers? 0.06257106818159155
do you trust elementary school teachers?  0.02777619034011792
you would probably begin by saying, to do what?  0.015718877363021206
and that would be a perfectly sensible response. 0.02777619034011792
and you might say, when you understood the answer to that, well, i trust some of them, but not others.  0.030761278460150743
that's a perfectly rational thing. 0.05795053470733952
in short, in our real lives, we seek to place trust in a differentiated way. 0.012285946074705657
we don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform. 0.0047858819807434635
i might, for example, say that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know to teach the reception class to read, but in no way to drive the school minibus. 0.01012090815331229
i might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver. 0.021972813874997166
i might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret. 0.018693000799960027
simple. 0.09069748827745895
so if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated, why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly? 0.0064145068059023305
i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists, because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust. 0.059596152114584695
secondly, what about the aim? 0.028517539529041507
the aim is to have more trust. 0.03155984539112946
well frankly, i think that's a stupid aim. 0.3237722713145643
it's not what i would aim at. 0.16102307266026747
i would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy. 0.010946291355069202
in fact, i aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy. 0.06192758923768256
and i think, of those people who, for example, placed their savings with the very aptly named mr. madoff, who then made off with them, and i think of them, and i think, well, yes, too much trust. 0.03200512175383545
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life. 0.04131551591106297
intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim. 0.01041441909198652
well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness. 0.021327532729138933
it's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects. 0.028123983923787663
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things. 0.17395797375642233
are they competent? are they honest? are they reliable? 0.02915032279375143
and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters, and reliable and honest, we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them, because they'll be trustworthy. 0.008510635385232392
but if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not. 0.030452555559828284
i have friends who are competent and honest, but i would not trust them to post a letter, because they're forgetful. 0.0919578260132217
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things, but i realize that they overestimate their own competence. 0.056586356745712406
and i'm very glad to say, i don't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest. 0.045721317925261906
if so, i haven't yet spotted it. 0.04088625045456414
but that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before trust. 0.020200106912694155
trust is the response. 0.12909944487358058
trustworthiness is what we have to judge. and, of course, it's difficult. 0.08910017878980071
across the last few decades, we've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness. 0.004628752909227427
a lot of these systems have the converse effect. 0.02777619034011792
they don't work as they're supposed to. 0.062425357566781164
i remember i was talking with a midwife who said, well, you see, the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby.  0.030744212557072603
and all over our public life, our institutional life, we find that problem, that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite. 0.0070829616979508955
it is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks, like midwives, from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say. 0.01578553134144601
you can all give your own examples there. 0.0670144447096575
so so much for the aim. 0.040824829046386304
the aim, i think, is more trustworthiness, and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people, and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy. 0.025841440319642913
it's not easy. it is judgment, and simple reaction, attitudes, don't do adequately here. 0.013508100454695889
now thirdly, the task. 0.028709564316081952
calling the task rebuilding trust, i think, also gets things backwards. 0.062284969540134474
it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust. 0.024088562704853513
well, we can do that for ourselves. 0.09578464408619825
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness. 0.056122223243057295
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust. 0.015775377779808884
but trust, in the end, is distinctive because it's given by other people. 0.011833064662823948
you can't rebuild what other people give you. 0.27091988546756285
you have to give them the basis for giving you their trust. 0.0202355539266737
so you have to, i think, be trustworthy. 0.04328649145305472
and that, of course, is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time, usually. 0.01923314763670773
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy. 0.0341599190576228
how to do it? 0.028517539529041507
well every day, all over the place, it's being done by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions, quite effectively. 0.02900697051073635
let me give you a simple commercial example. 0.025124218547395095
the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back, and they don't ask any questions. 0.011328360454400999
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color i wanted. 0.022889127940682732
that's super. i trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me. 0.017298187366649485
i think there's a big lesson in that. 0.039320498864645864
if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party, then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying. 0.04489977427301925
so in the end, i think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern. 0.08086779582453094
it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy. 0.028203153756681414
so the moral of all this is, we need to think much less about trust, let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls, much more about being trustworthy, and how you give people adequate, useful and simple evidence that you're trustworthy. 0.011843220132847793
thanks. 0.316227766016838
you know, my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch. 0.015138514598766055
i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we got to watch the wizard of oz together. 0.015514392335273455
it totally dominated her imagination for months. 0.013679192123121896
her favorite character was glinda, of course. 0.017033186037639283
it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand. 0.010862721615727716
but you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is. 0.012384901282810543
now we live today, and are raising our children, in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex. 0.007087648989046159
but the wizard of oz stood alone. 0.025098621243978974
it did not start that trend. 0.03155984539112946
forty years later was when the trend really caught on, with, interestingly, another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards. 0.007567143835953721
do you know what i'm talking about? 0.02777619034011792
yeah. 0.1495348781221221
now, there's a big difference between these two movies, a couple of really big differences between the wizard of oz and all the movies we watch today. 0.017997802579930305
one is there's very little violence in the wizard of oz.  0.04682414808941458
the monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees. 0.018693000799960027
but i think if the wizard of oz were made today, the wizard would say, dorothy, you are the savior of oz that the prophecy foretold. 0.07569298710889658
use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the wicked witch.  0.009629943614188135
but that's not how it happens. 0.06518210333288976
another thing that's really unique about the wizard of oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female. 0.014082645505119472
now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter, which was years later, and the situation was different. 0.009752505550693367
at that point i also had a son. 0.03155984539112946
he was only three at the time. 0.0169861974906263
he was not invited to the screening. he was too young for that. 0.035688169895915674
but he was the second child, and the level of supervision had plummeted. 0.011729176379814873
so he wandered in, and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling, and i don't think he understands what's going on, but he is sure soaking in it. 0.019505011101386728
and i wonder what he's soaking in. 0.05022037190492093
is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty? 0.019383418023456653
is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government? 0.008687475782716616
is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for aunt beru, and of course this princess, who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he does by the magic that he was born with? 0.008510635385232392
compare this to 1939 with the wizard of oz.  0.011502783619900045
how does dorothy win her movie? 0.028517539529041507
by making friends with everybody and being a leader. 0.014216645907653848
that's kind of the world i'd rather raise my kids in -- oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting, which is where we kind of have to be. 0.01699960348373781
why is there so much force -- capital f, force -- in the movies we have for our kids, and so little yellow brick road? 0.007567143835953721
there is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls, and you should do that reading. it's very good. 0.041495629056849774
i haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe. 0.014400124446705301
i know from my own experience that princess leia did not provide the adequate context that i could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed. 0.016496625424967437
i think there was a first-kiss moment when i really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right? 0.03566087490853475
i finished my quest, i got the girl. 0.025725069574826766
why are you still standing there? 0.06500593260343691
i don't know what i'm supposed to do. 0.2044800736021839
the movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys. 0.03184072509309614
it's almost as though if you're a boy, you are a dopey animal, and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume. 0.013136602547521059
there are plenty of exceptions, and i will defend the disney princesses in front of any you. 0.08170076901488413
but they do send a message to boys, that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience. 0.06183522915385178
they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy, but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy. 0.01888979634684977
there's no models for them. 0.10489671869455933
and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids, and as three-dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are, these are still war movies. 0.02624308202742789
and, of course, the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic, every single one of them about the journey of a boy, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl. 0.06375872491703768
until, as many of you are thinking, this year, when they finally came out with brave.  0.012990806323574158
i recommend it to all of you. it's on demand now. 0.01853140878532704
do you remember what the critics said when brave came out? 0.017502413882486995
 aw, i can't believe pixar made a princess movie.  0.03581550766007748
it's very good. don't let that stop you. 0.020448007360218394
now, almost none of these movies pass the bechdel test. 0.033241378434410024
i don't know if you've heard of this. 0.43361890903486755
it has not yet caught on and caught fire, but maybe today we will start a movement. 0.02191286020886785
alison bechdel is a comic book artist, and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw. 0.007567143835953721
and it's very simple. there's just three questions you should ask: is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines? 0.026507715366207475
so try to meet that bar. 0.048549177170732344
and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie? 0.01284618972676772
and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like? 0.014669198133192292
right? thank you. 0.05501080739920602
thank you very much. 0.10785809837243004
two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff. 0.007913247271422612
it does happen. i've seen it, and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love. 0.026943533707378245
in fact, this week i went to see a very high-quality movie, argo.  0.030064545690526145
right? oscar buzz, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality hollywood film is. 0.009498525867740094
it pretty much flunks the bechdel test. 0.02846946938149362
and i don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, i don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis. 0.02940462876945035
we've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout, and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say, are you coming to bed, honey?  0.011427015724517037
that's hollywood for you. 0.07440995947486906
so let's look at the numbers. 0.0439891724758422
2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists? 0.010864991539917157
eleven. it's not bad. 0.11404605374835301
it's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to congress, so that's good. 0.019051955393615476
but there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down. 0.14170562170415987
last year, the new york times published a study that the government had done. 0.023830412565256146
here's what it said. 0.048549177170732344
one out of five women in america say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life. 0.005919382824640357
now, i don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment. 0.09018015286108234
i don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that. 0.03536389861883236
i don't even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that, but something is going wrong, and when i hear that statistic, one of the things i think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants. 0.028598254780763704
who are these guys? what are they learning? 0.024761510494160165
what are they failing to learn? 0.03455747170954952
are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak? 0.007800772536265703
are we soaking up that story? 0.028240990488565418
you know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them. 0.02538402946795242
we have tools at our disposal like girl power, and we hope that that will help, but i gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them if, at the same time, actively or passively, we are training our sons to maintain their boy power? 0.015134287671907443
i mean, i think the netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important, and i'm talking mainly to the dads here. 0.007711727065811939
i think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood. 0.07174630278990472
the definition of manhood is already turning upside down. 0.04361566471268858
you've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner. 0.015721757597198516
they're throwing it up in the air. 0.02777619034011792
so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other, and i think we really have to show them, and model for them, how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them, and wants to be on their team, and stands up against the real bad guys, who are the men who want to abuse the women. 0.0882282125591373
and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the bechdel test, if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines who are there, who show real courage, who bring people together, and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say, i want to be on their team, because they're going to be on their team. 0.09257505818454852
when i asked my daughter who her favorite character was in star wars, do you know what she said? 0.026058929270445657
obi-wan. 0.1495348781221221
obi-wan kenobi and glinda. 0.048549177170732344
what do these two have in common? 0.023980296761827107
maybe it's not just the sparkly dress. 0.025098621243978974
i think these people are experts. 0.3419177649965185
i think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential. 0.030002843173508643
now, they are leaders. 0.09554427922043669
i like that kind of quest for my daughter, and i like that kind of quest for my son. 0.02297185935845028
i want more quests like that. 0.03849815007763549
i want fewer quests where my son is told, go out and fight it alone, and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people become better and be better people, like the wizard of oz. 0.010423357040347159
thank you. 0.316227766016838
i would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid. 0.015138514598766055
i don't know his name, but i do know his story. 0.06892964965915206
he lives in a small village in southern somalia. 0.04131551591106297
his village is near mogadishu. 0.03455747170954952
drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. 0.005474870710453651
with nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, mogadishu, the capital of somalia. 0.008939891008723787
when he arrives, there are no opportunities, no jobs, no way forward. 0.027076576267554473
he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of mogadishu. 0.006510755202591488
maybe a year passes, nothing. 0.021105340631872645
one day, he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch, then to dinner, to breakfast. 0.024391857519848407
he meets this dynamic group of people, and they give him a break. 0.010862721615727716
he's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes, money to send back home to his family. 0.020876149875884896
he is introduced to this young woman. 0.01553712569276035
he eventually gets married. 0.028517539529041507
he starts this new life. 0.028517539529041507
he has a purpose in life. 0.14113991930789777
one beautiful day in mogadishu, under an azure blue sky, a car bomb goes off. 0.004546382520112882
that small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to al qaeda. 0.00978862062356798
so how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up? 0.0077426364109627836
he was waiting. 0.05795053470733952
he was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along. 0.00978862062356798
this was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood. 0.06357877332311639
and his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world. 0.007987276352377327
it is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in johannesburg, sparks riots in london, who reaches out for something other than waithood. 0.008510635385232392
for young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. 0.022769146665041463
often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. 0.01606243474117787
by 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. 0.009970222994544455
if we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them opportunities, the story of waithood, the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the story of cities 2.0. 0.05778321719122542
and in my city of birth, mogadishu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment. 0.008830895300928163
70 percent don't work, don't go to school. 0.04790437745835816
they pretty much do nothing. 0.03414161815331289
i went back to mogadishu last month, and i went to visit madina hospital, the hospital i was born in. 0.053414136238197775
i remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking, what if i had never left? 0.013023957260262857
what if i had been forced into that same state of waithood? 0.018476860420522198
would i have become a terrorist? 0.039281465090051315
i'm not really sure about the answer. 0.05752300429522425
my reason for being in mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit. 0.0045491487595968995
i brought together about 90 young somali leaders. 0.021105340631872645
we sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city. 0.0151463165231073
one of the young men in the room was aden. 0.024808415001701823
he went to university in mogadishu, graduated. 0.0169861974906263
there were no jobs, no opportunities. 0.04479896078974043
i remember him telling me, because he was a college graduate, unemployed, frustrated, that he was the perfect target for al shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited. 0.011535340779133254
they sought people like him out. 0.04739878501170794
but his story takes a different route. 0.02777619034011792
in mogadishu, the biggest barrier to getting from point a to point b are the roads. 0.013661822578494706
twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. 0.005508606419495829
aden saw an opportunity and seized it. 0.02054901307230194
he started a motorbike company. 0.06846046760764757
he began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. 0.021400047286221472
he bought 10 bikes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years. 0.003384129602542209
how is this story different? 0.035104358299585095
what makes his story different? 0.02944656445786981
i believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. 0.015226277779914149
it's entrepreneurship, and i believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. 0.05587443695709437
it empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking. 0.010862721615727716
and you can train young people to be entrepreneurs. 0.024808415001701823
i want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, mohamed mohamoud, a florist. 0.04370614964591188
he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship. 0.007942181016469338
he's actually the first florist mogadishu has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until mohamed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. 0.01012090815331229
if you asked someone, when was the last time you saw fresh flowers? for many who grew up under civil war, the answer would be, never.  0.013792125616909453
so mohamed saw an opportunity. 0.02777619034011792
he started a landscaping and design floral company. 0.0428361950754725
he created a farm right outside of mogadishu, and started growing tulips and lilies, which he said could survive the harsh mogadishu climate. 0.004255317692616196
and he began delivering flowers to weddings, creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city, and he's now working on creating mogadishu's first public park in 22 years. 0.00601792799310401
there's no public park in mogadishu. 0.09662504873924324
he wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together, and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses. 0.01157101918868361
and he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water, by the way. 0.02542254141389555
so the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room. 0.004024431001434524
they had never really thought about starting up a business. 0.025132936350227657
they've thought about working for an ngo, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact on them. 0.008231215992636891
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. 0.023501661818361337
he empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be change makers. 0.014400124446705301
by the end of the day, they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city. 0.025615281086261293
they came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems. 0.030934588294313718
so inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality. 0.01209685959137829
they need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses. 0.02437129125970136
connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth. 0.034038042427431366
for me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business. 0.018002829271425148
it's about creating a social impact. 0.04049515890265692
mohamed is not simply selling flowers. 0.03303164318013808
i believe he is selling hope. 0.040824829046386304
his peace park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city. 0.013948420003997713
aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. 0.015276780223747026
he gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. 0.01041441909198652
these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities. 0.01340082578177889
so my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and peace parks than of car bombs and waithood. 0.01070155744123372
thank you. 0.05501080739920602
when i was a child growing up in maine, one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of maine, because my parents told me it would bring me luck. 0.020874365970730738
but you know, these shells, they're hard to find. 0.026658376817028855
they're covered in sand. they're difficult to see. 0.11192003885776358
however, overtime, i got used to looking for them. 0.03609023856222073
i started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them. 0.033241378434410024
this grew into a passion for finding things, a love for the past and archaeology. 0.0067177027389942
and eventually when i started studying egyptology, i realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. 0.031523163715960874
because all of the sudden in egypt my beach had grown from a tiny beach in maine to one eight hundred miles long next to the nile, and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. 0.00601792799310401
this is really what brought me to using satellite imagery. 0.039524926351130286
for trying to map the past, i knew that i had to see differently. 0.03889818545474848
so i want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared. 0.028927969316143217
this is a site located in the eastern egyptian delta called bendix. 0.015671287677272196
and the site visibly appears brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color, the site appears as bright pink. 0.007920038643543535
what you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient egyptians. 0.036612667086152566
what i want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient egyptian city, called itjtawy, missing for thousands of years. 0.016748842534043438
itjtawy was ancient egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the middle kingdom about four thousand years ago. 0.011842046122543795
the site is located in the faiyum of egypt and site is really important because in the middle kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient egyptian art, architecture and religion. 0.004453765026369045
egyptologists have always known the site of itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive flood plane. 0.003384129602542209
this area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size. 0.015718877363021206
the nile used to flow right next to the city of itjtawy, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east, it covered over the city. 0.007156562786973337
so, how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape? 0.01618861356572822
finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack, blindfolded wearing baseball mitts. 0.0107197986970105
so what we did is we used nasa topography data to map out the landscape, very subtle changes. 0.012534724690717635
we started to be able to see where the nile used to flow. 0
but you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here, which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of itjtawy. 0.013319864208053298
so we collaborated with the egyptian scientists to do coring work, which you see here. 0.03187271473320672
when i say coring, it's like ice coring, but instead of layers of climate change you're looking for layers of human occupation. 0.01773054311822993
and five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of pottery. 0.0037451550450560973
what this shows is that at this possible location of itjtawy, five meters down, we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the middle kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think itjtawy is. 0.0037451550450560973
we also found work stone -- carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there was a jewelers workshop here. 0.009165279057815818
these might not look like much, but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the middle kingdom, these are the stones that were used. 0.00994291166603031
so, we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the middle kingdom at this site. 0.05415315253510895
we also have evidence of an elite jewelers workshop, showing that whatever was there was a very important city. 0.004744188024111083
no itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out. 0.007939087147543497
and even more importantly, we have funding to train young egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well. 0.01119951575382439
so i wanted to end with my favorite quote from the middle kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of itjtawy four thousand years ago. 0.01740690250757329
 sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings. 0.05022037190492093
there's nothing like it in the land.  0.025124218547395095
so as it turns out, ted was not founded in 1984 ad. 0.032709344708772174
making ideas actually started in 1984 bc at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above. 0.0038253628844009133
it certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective. 0.007913247271422612
thank you very much. 0.10785809837243004
thank you. 0.316227766016838
growing up in taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of chinese characters. 0.008231215992636891
ever since then, i was fascinated by this incredible language. 0.016275776313613193
but to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china. 0.008186841244220632
over the past few years, i've been wondering if i can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. 0.01120062606421828
i started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning chinese might be useful. 0.009629943614188135
since the age of five, i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. 0.009970222994544455
i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years. 0.01284618972676772
since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. 0.006734719128165655
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters. 0.020255986027125642
you only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy. 0.02043370997308395
the top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. 0.010959611470090962
today i'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. 0.04179882049216857
you are ready? 0.09554427922043669
open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. 0.015842132538336173
you get a mouth. 0.06389431042462725
this is a person going for a walk. 0.033031643180138064
person. 0.1495348781221221
if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, help! i'm on fire! -- this symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame, but i like to think that way. whichever works for you. 0.01120062606421828
this is a tree. 0.07440995947486906
tree. 0.1495348781221221
this is a mountain. 0.06257106818159155
the sun. 0.11362193664674995
the moon. 0.13512001548070346
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. 0.02560744480557418
i call these eight characters radicals. 0.039281465090051315
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. 0.018798317647335087
a person. 0.08034284189446518
if someone walks behind, that is to follow.  0.026658376817028855
as the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd. 0.006510755202591488
if a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, it was this big.  0.012673718536830811
the person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. 0.04167227247694064
he's a prisoner, just like jonah inside the whale. 0.03155984539112946
one tree is a tree. two trees together, we have the woods. 0.008531104334876973
three trees together, we create the forest. 0.08263103182212594
put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation. 0.02297185935845028
put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's idiot.  0.01340082578177889
easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. 0.018693000799960027
remember fire? 0.020237345084409754
two fires together, i get really hot. 0.024808415001701823
three fires together, that's a lot of flames. 0.04939382737115371
set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning. 0.015718877363021206
for us, the sun is the source of prosperity. 0.02984745896009824
two suns together, prosperous. 0.03303164318013808
three together, that's sparkles. 0.056122223243057295
put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. 0.03592143420342892
it also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. 0.020200106912694155
the sun is coming up above the horizon. sunrise. 0.017033186037639283
a door. put a plank inside the door, it's a door bolt. 0.011451997463067555
put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. 0.01428363257865929
knock knock. is anyone home? 0.0351487760467425
this person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. 0.01618861356572822
on the left, we have a woman. 0.028517539529041507
two women together, they have an argument. 0.020255986027125642
three women together, be careful, it's adultery. 0.025098621243978974
so we have gone through almost 30 characters. 0.10025157431478134
by using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. 0.012673718536830811
the next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. 0.011451997463067555
so with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a chinese eight-year-old. 0.016373682488441264
so after we know the characters, we start building phrases. 0.03592143420342892
for example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. it's a volcano. 0.015436464226810553
we know japan is the land of the rising sun. 0.2620251007173262
this is a sun placed with the origin, because japan lies to the east of china. 0.014906383786801687
so a sun, origin together, we build japan. 0.09669265690880861
a person behind japan, what do we get? 0.020255986027125642
a japanese person. 0.048549177170732344
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. 0.01618861356572822
in ancient china, that means in exile, because chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. 0.0062589852960783475
nowadays, exile has turned into getting out. 0.012109013026441871
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. 0.015718877363021206
this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage. thank you. 0.024358554985340126
